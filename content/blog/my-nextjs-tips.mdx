# 10 Next.js Tips for Better Performance

Next.js is an incredible framework for building React applications, but there are several techniques you can use to optimize your apps for better performance and user experience.

## 1. Use Image Optimization

Next.js provides built-in image optimization with the `next/image` component:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/my-image.jpg"
      alt="Description"
      width={500}
      height={300}
      priority // For above-the-fold images
    />
  )
}
```

## 2. Implement Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code, but you can optimize further:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false // If component doesn't need SSR
})
```

## 3. Use Static Generation When Possible

For pages that don't change often, use Static Site Generation (SSG):

```tsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 3600 // Revalidate every hour
  }
}
```

## 4. Optimize Your Bundle

Use the built-in bundle analyzer:

```bash
npm install @next/bundle-analyzer
```

## 5. Leverage Caching

Implement proper caching strategies:

```tsx
export async function getServerSideProps({ res }) {
  res.setHeader(
    'Cache-Control',
    'public, s-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=59'
  )
  return { props: {} }
}
```

## Conclusion

These tips will help you build faster, more efficient Next.js applications. Remember to always measure performance before and after implementing optimizations!
